## Floating platform concepts 

There are basically three concepts : 
- Barge
- Spar Buoy
- Tension leg 
- Semi-submersible 


##### Barge
- stabilized by buoyancy 
- basically a pontoon  

##### Spar Buoy 
- stabilized by weight


##### Tension leg
- buoyant structure "pulled" under water


#### Semi submersible 
- like a barge but submerged slightly 



#### Feasible concepts 
- spar buoy vs semi-submersible 

- spar buoy is more simple 
- s.b probably less prone to wave excitation
- s.b. can be tuned (mass, damping, buoyancy, buoyancy distribution)

- s.b. might be problematic during installation (towing, vortex shedding, weird dynamics)
- harder to correct angles in a spar buoy 

- semi-submersible: resistance to large waves ? 
- submersion in comparison to wave height might be small
