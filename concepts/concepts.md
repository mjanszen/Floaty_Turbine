## Floating platform concepts 

There are basically three concepts : 
- Barge
- Spar Buoy
- Tension leg 
- Semi-submersible 


##### Barge
- stabilized by buoyancy 
- basically a pontoon  

##### Spar Buoy 
- stabilized by weight


##### Tension leg
- buoyant structure "pulled" under water


#### Semi submersible 
- like a barge but submerged slightly 



#### Feasible concepts 
- spar buoy vs semi-submersible
