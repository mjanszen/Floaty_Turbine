### Project proposal 


### Design approach

Find out environmental conditions
- distributions, probable conditions 
- extreme wind and wave conditions 

Decision : design for ?
- average day ? 
- extreme conditions ? 
- 50 days conditions ? 


Concept decision: 
- weighted decision (matrix) ? 
- the most fun approach ? 
- the simplest approach ? 


Static calculations 
- Centre of gravity
- Centre Buoyancy  
- Deflection under loading (Thrust) 

Dynamic calculations 
- modes: rigid body modes 
- effects of mooring lines? 

Experiments 
- Static experiments
- Damping 


##### Some Ideas 
- Increase of tower height possible ? 
- Multiple ballast options ? Low wind, less ballast ? High wind, more mass, more stable ? 
- Can water ballast be used to adapt the platform to the conditions ? 
- What is the best fit to the design conditions ?
